basleR Package for Price Analysis
=================================

This is a set of R functions, which are stored on a private Github Repositiory. 

### Install 

To install basleR from Githab requires the devtools package. That means it is first
necessary to install this from CRAN, i.e., run the following commands:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RSelenium", "johndharrison")
```

To get started using `basleR` I'm going to write an introduction vignette. This 
is going to be located in `/doc/basleR-basics.html` once `basleR` is installed or run

```
vignette('basleR-basics')
```

### License

The copyright of the basleR package belong mostly to me, as 95% of it is written
on my own computer on my spear time. See the seperate LICENCE file for more information.
