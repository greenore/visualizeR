visualizeR
==========

This is a set of helper functions to facilitate price analysis trough visualization. 

### Install 

To install visualizeR from Github requires the devtools package. That means it is first
necessary to install this from CRAN, i.e., run the following commands:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo="greenore/visualizeR")
```

To get started using `visualizeR` I'm going to write an introduction vignette. This 
is going to be located in `/doc/visualizeR-basics.html` once `visualizeR` is installed or run

```
vignette('visualizeR-basics')
```
