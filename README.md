visualizeR
==========

This is a set of helper functions to facilitate price analysis trough visualization. 

### Install 

To install visualizeR from Github requires the devtools package from CRAN. That means running the following commands:

#### Windows:
```
source("https://rawgit.com/greenore/initR/master/init.R")
packagesGithub("visualizeR", repo_name="greenore")
```

#### Linux:
```
source(pipe(paste("wget -O -", "https://rawgit.com/greenore/initR/master/init.R")))
packagesGithub("visualizeR", repo_name="greenore")
```

To get started using `visualizeR` I'm going to write an introduction vignette. This 
is going to be located in `/doc/visualizeR-basics.html` once `visualizeR` is installed or run

```
vignette('visualizeR-basics')
```
